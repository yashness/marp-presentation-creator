# Working Agreements

## Required Reading (Before Any Work)
- `README.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `todo.md`
- `progress.md`

## Documentation Rules
- `todo.md` must never be deleted; they must be corrected and updated.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is a prescription and must be updated when plans or requirements change.
- `todo.md` must be synchronized with actual progress after every change.

## Delivery Principles
- Keep work aligned to outcomes, not implementation details.
- Prefer clear, consistent interfaces and behavior over cleverness.
- The UI must be wide, slick, and aesthetically cohesive.

## Styling Direction
- Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components.
- Two‑color theme with shades of those colors.
- Icons should be used intentionally across the UI.

## Quality & Validation (Mandatory)
- Validate everything using:
  - API calls for functional correctness.
  - Docker logs for runtime health.
  - Playwright to exercise UI flows and take screenshots.
- Confirm the UI is aesthetically polished before closing work.

## Code Quality Guidance
- Aim for functions around 10 lines when possible; it is a strong preference, not a hard rule.
- Keep comments minimal and purposeful.
- Maintain type hints and strong validation in data models.

## Progress Discipline
- Every task must include a step to update `todo.md` with current status.
- Adjust `todo.md` to realign with goals whenever scope shifts.
